IbPy - Interactive Brokers Python API
==============================================================================
IbPy 0.8.0-9.67 Indevelopment 04 Feb 2013


What is IbPy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy is a third-party implementation of the API by Troy Melhase 
used for accessing the Interactive Brokers on-line trading system.  
IbPy implements functionality that the Python programmer can use to connect to IB,
request stock ticker data, submit orders for stocks and futures, and
more.

The project has been in a dormant state by Troy since 2008 according to his 
website, but I have taken the most recent 9.67 version of the api and translated
it through java2python located at:

https://github.com/natural/java2python

and currently working on brining the code base to a working state based on 
the original java code and code written in the original IbPy. 
 
What's new in this release?

  * Support for TWS API version 9.67 is ongoing

How do I use IbPy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are the requirements?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy requires Python 2.5 or newer.  Previous versions are not supported.

TWS requires a web browser capable of executing Sun(R) Java(tm)
applets.  TWS can also be started directly with Sun(R) Java(tm) and
the stand-alone package supplied by Interactive Brokers.


What is Interactive Brokers?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the page "`About The Interactive Brokers Group`__":

  Interactive Brokers conducts its broker/dealer and proprietary trading
  businesses on 60 market centers worldwide. In its broker dealer agency
  business, IB provides direct access ("on line") trade execution and
  clearing services to institutional and professional traders for a wide
  variety of electronically traded products including options, futures,
  stocks, forex, and bonds worldwide. In its proprietary trading
  business IB engages in market making for its own account in about
  6,500 different electronically traded products. Interactive Brokers
  Group and its affiliates now trade 19% of the worldâ€™s exchange traded
  equity options*, and executes approximately 500,000 trades per day.


What is Python?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the page "`What is Python?`__":

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
  language.  It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

  Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has
  modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
  dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and
  libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
  Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python
  is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a
  programmable interface.

  The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,
  on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't
  listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for
  it. Ask around on comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python
  yourself.

  The Python implementation is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable,
  even for commercial use.
